<!-- This is just a simple list with ng-repeat. You could play 
	 removing the "track by" or joining the two interpolations 
	 in one, so the results in the performance test would vary,
	 first in the time and second in the number of watchers -->

    <li ng-repeat="item in $ctrl.items track by $index">
        Index: {{ $index }} / Value: {{ item }}
